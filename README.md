SuperBeast?


Corey is going to look into CSS and an object to add facts

Beast olivia and jaxon keep being cool

Got a stomach bug at work so I went ahead and made the content editable. If it doesn't work just let me know and I'll reupload the og code.
- Jaxon 
It did work! - Olivia

Hey I made a branch for this project with an A-Z sort feature at the bottom of the fact list
I did not want to overwrite in case others had something coming
So we need to have my branch as the most current and add to that
-Corey

I am trying to do the feature fact for the last extra. If anyone wants to take a stab at it before next class, feel free.
I am going to try to work on it during the weekend, if I get the chance. I haven't uploaded any of that since I haven't got it
working and didn't want to override what we have working. If someone does a different extra, totally fine (just please leave
a note stating so) -Olivia

I think I got the random question working - Jaxon
